## Description
This was the final project as part of a Udemy course - [The Complete JavaScript Course 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/).
Forkify is a recipe finding web application which uses data from the [Forkify](https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/v2) API. While it is a fairly basic web application, it can be used as a guide to cook one's favorite dish. Beyond accessing recipes from different sources online, it also provides information on the number and amount of ingredients needed to build a specific dish according to the number of people to serve.
